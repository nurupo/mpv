-- Resizes the window in specific steps.
--
-- 1, 1/2 and 1/4 are obvious.
-- 1/1.5, 1/3 and 1/6, assuming the input is on 1920x1080, will resize it to
-- 1, 1/2 and 1/3 of 1280x720. The reason for this is that if I don't want to
-- watch a 1920x1080 video in full screen, 1/2 of it is too small, but 1/1.5,
-- i.e. 1280x720 - just perfect. 1/3 is useful when splitting the screen on 2/3
-- for a main window, e.g. a code editor, and 1/3 for a video on a side. 1/6 is
-- just for the completeness, to match 1/4.
